    Modified HallOfFame class taken from the DEAP library
    (https://github.com/DEAP/deap/blob/master/deap/tools/support.py#L488).
    The introduced modifications allow for:
        - a inverted classification (the last individual is the best) in comparison with the original
        - individuals are inserted in the hall of fame according to the following scheme:
            1 - for_feasible is checked, if is True, the best individuals are those with a penalty = 0 (last
                fitness function) and the lowest first fitness function
                1.1 - the individuals with a penalty = 0 are prioritized and then are compared on the value of the first
                      fitness function; the one with the lowest value are inserted.
                1.2 - the individuals with a penalty !=0 are compared on the sum of both the fitness. The ones with the
                      lowest sum are inserted
            2 - if for_feasible is False, the sum of both fitness is considered and the ones with the lowest sum
                are inserted
