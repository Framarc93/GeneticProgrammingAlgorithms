# Genetic Programming Algorithms

This folder contains the Genetic Programming (GP) algorithms developed by Francesco Marchetti. 
The algorithms are built using the DEAP library (https://github.com/deap/deap) and many functions
are a modification of the functions implemented in DEAP.

The folder contains the code to apply the following algorithms:
* Inclusive Genetic Programming (IGP) [1]
* Full Inclusive Genetic Programming (FIGP) [2]
* Python implementation of the Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (pyMGGP)

The IGP was developed by Francesco Marchetti during his PhD at the University of Strathclyde and originally published 
online at https://github.com/strath-ace/smart-ml/tree/master/GP/GP_Algorithms/IGP. It has been republished in this 
folder in order to keep it up to date. The IGP was used in 

The pyMGGP is a Python implementation of the MGGP originally introduced by Hinchliffe et al. [3] and later made 
available by Searson et al. [4] in the open source GPTIPS matlab library [5].

The source code to use the aforementioned algorithms is contained in the `src` folder, while some regression and control
applications examples are contained in the `examples` folder.
